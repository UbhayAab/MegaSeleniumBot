The scene should have a clean, vibrant, modern cartoon look, similar to animated illustrations used in professional presentations or business infographics, not like AI face cartoons or overly stylized filters. Avoid close-up or portrait focus, instead capture the full environment or landscape, showing people, objects, and scenery from a distance to create a sense of space and scale. The colors should be bright but balanced, with soft gradients, smooth lines, and minimal exaggerated facial features.  Think of the composition like a professional editorial illustration, suitable for a business context, with subtle cartoonish charm, clear storytelling, and no childish or comic-book effects. The style should lean towards flat design with depth (shadows, layering), giving a polished and engaging feel. Do not include close-up faces or heavily stylized characters, keep human or object elements small or medium-sized within the scene, and focus on the overall visual appeal from a distance.
